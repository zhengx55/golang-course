/*
In the Go programming language, a string is a sequence of bytes that represent characters/runes.
It is a built-in data type that is used to store and manipulate text data.

Strings in Go are represented as a sequence of bytes and are immutable,
which means that once a string is created, its value cannot be changed.
However, it is possible to create a new string by concatenating two or more existing strings.

In Go, strings are enclosed in double quotes (" ") or backticks ( ), and can contain any Unicode character.
For example:

name := "Alice"

message := `Hello, world!
My message is now on two lines.
`

emoji := "ðŸ˜€"
