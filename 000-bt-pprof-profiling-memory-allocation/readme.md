In Go, you can't directly query a variable to find out how much memory it has allocated. However, you can get some insights into the memory usage of your Go program as a whole using the `runtime` and `runtime/pprof` packages.

Here's a simple example using the `runtime` package:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"runtime"
)

func main() {
	var mem runtime.MemStats
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&mem)

	fmt.Printf("Before allocation: %v MiB\n", mem.Alloc/1024/1024)

	mySlice := make([]int, 0, 9999999)

	runtime.ReadMemStats(&mem)
	fmt.Printf("After allocation: %v MiB\n", mem.Alloc/1024/1024)

	mySlice = nil

	runtime.GC() // Force garbage collection
	runtime.ReadMemStats(&mem)
	fmt.Printf("After GC: %v MiB\n", mem.Alloc/1024/1024)
}
```

In this example, we check memory allocation before and after creating a large slice. We also check it after setting the slice to `nil` and forcing garbage collection.

However, it's worth mentioning that the numbers reported are for the entire program, not just the single variable.

You can also profile your application using pprof to understand memory usage in more detail, which can be useful for debugging memory leaks or optimizing your code.

Here's a very simple example that writes the memory profile to a file:

```go
package main

import (
	"os"
	"runtime/pprof"
)

func main() {
	f, err := os.Create("mem.pprof")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
	defer f.Close()

	pprof.WriteHeapProfile(f)
}
```

You can then analyze this file using the `pprof` tool:

```bash
go tool pprof mem.pprof
```

Again, these tools provide insights into the program as a whole, not individual variables. But they can still be very useful for understanding the memory behavior of your Go applications.
