00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.150
(warm music)

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.800
<v ->I wanna start class by sharing with you</v>

3
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.120
one of my favorite quotes,

4
00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.860
and it's a quote from Marcus Aurelius.

5
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.267
And Marcus Aurelius said this,

6
00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:13.410
"The first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit.

7
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.990
The second is to look things in the face

8
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.730
and know them for what they are."

9
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.410
So that's what we're gonna do in this course,

10
00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.330
is we're gonna look stress in the face.

11
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.940
We're gonna look at the new research and science

12
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.280
behind modern, current best practices

13
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.930
for managing or working with stress,

14
00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.720
both individually and collectively.

15
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.140
And in more thoroughly understanding stress,

16
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.110
we're gonna be able to more effectively work with stress,

17
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.670
and then that's gonna allow us to achieve

18
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.990
more optimal performance

19
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.960
both individually, collectively, teams, organizations,

20
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.970
businesses, churches, communities, right?

21
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.070
Whatever organization you're involved with,

22
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.870
both individually and collectively

23
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.270
we're gonna be able to achieve more optimal performance.

24
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.530
And when stress arises,

25
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.750
we're gonna be able to more effectively maintain

26
00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.330
that calm spirit, that uncontrolled spirit,

27
00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.640
'cause we'll know stress more thoroughly

28
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.740
and we'll know how to work with it more effectively.

29
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:03.270
So that's the goal of this course.

30
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.460
And it's all research backed.

31
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.310
So this is all based upon the latest and greatest research,

32
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.140
and there's new science and research

33
00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.600
and it's new in the sense that it upends

34
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.270
and disrupts and changes the old approach

35
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.160
to working with and managing stress.

36
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.240
So there's new research

37
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.370
about how to best manage and work with stress.

38
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.990
We're gonna learn that in the course.

39
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.000
It's all gonna be thoroughly documented.

40
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.510
This course is gonna be a high level summary overview

41
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.790
of all this research that I've synthesized

42
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.720
and brought together,

43
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
and so you'll be able to learn it all in a really quick way,

44
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.890
and we're also going to have, you know,

45
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.540
practical and applicable ways

46
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.640
that we can apply it in our life, right?

47
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.340
But if you wanna reinforce everything that you're learning,

48
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.650
all of that research is gonna be documented in the course

49
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.060
so you can look at that research

50
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.430
and you can explore additional resources

51
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.960
to further reinforce

52
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.850
everything that you're gonna learn in this course.

53
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.470
Because I believe it is my job

54
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.810
as an academic, a researcher, and a teacher

55
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.120
to unearth that which isn't widely known

56
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.130
and to bring it into the world to others,

57
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.840
and so that's what I've done here in this course.

58
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.720
And it's based upon the research of the top academics

59
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.790
at the top institutions around the world,

60
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.200
including Stanford, Harvard,

61
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.390
the American Psychological Association,

62
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.690
and even research that has been done internally at Google,

63
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.790
how to most effectively get teams

64
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.530
to achieve their optimal performance

65
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.970
and have less stress in them.

66
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.740
So we're gonna see all that in the course.

67
00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.810
So the primary takeaway from this course

68
00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.880
is that the mind is powerful.

69
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.350
So I just want you to know this,

70
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.670
right here, at the very beginning,

71
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.340
what are the primary key takeaways from the entire course?

72
00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.530
The primary takeaway from the entire course

73
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.150
is that the mind is powerful

74
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.950
and that the perspectives, the stories,

75
00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.560
the narratives that we tell ourselves about stress,

76
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.515
the context in which we hold stress when stress arises,

77
00:02:44.515 --> 00:02:46.980
has a profound impact

78
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.290
upon how effectively we deal with stress.

79
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.480
And the impact is so profound,

80
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.780
it even changes our physiological, biological response

81
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.130
to stressful events.

82
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.990
When we have a skillful narrative,

83
00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.490
when we have a skillful perspective,

84
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.513
when we're holding stress in a skillful context,

85
00:03:02.513 --> 00:03:06.810
that changes how well we respond to that stressful event.

86
00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.120
So we're gonna learn the skillful narratives

87
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.560
as we go through the course,

88
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.170
and you're gonna learn how to apply those in your own life.

89
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.210
Secondary takeaways from this course

90
00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.340
in managing stress most effectively

91
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.740
are the importance of sleep, exercise, nutrition,

92
00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.530
belonging, and psychological safety.

93
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.520
So we're gonna learn all that,

94
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.320
and a lot of that stuff can be common sense

95
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.190
but all too often common sense is not common practice.

96
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.560
And so we're gonna see and reinforce.

97
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.460
If you already know stuff,

98
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.070
we'll reinforce the importance of these things in your life.

99
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.960
And if these things are new to you,

100
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.280
you're gonna see the research,

101
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.860
which is is gonna emphasize the importance

102
00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.650
of making sure these areas of your life are on point

103
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:45.120
because they're all going to help you

104
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.850
to more effectively manage and work with stress

105
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.880
so that you could achieve optimal performance

106
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.310
both individually in your own life

107
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.660
and then also collectively

108
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.120
within organizations, teams, businesses.

109
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.260
So that's the goal of the course.

110
00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.093
That's what we're gonna do.

111
00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:00.090
I'm glad you're here.

112
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.293
Let's get started.
