1
00:00:00,653 --> 00:00:03,270
(gentle music)

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,770
- All right, I wanna
give you a few details

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,603
about this course.

4
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,430
And the first thing I wanna
share with you is how we learn.

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,380
And this is me with one
of the greatest teachers

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,913
in my life, my mom,

7
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:15,690
and this course, I'll say this
right here at the beginning,

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,130
this course is going to be

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,580
drawing upon personal
experiences from my own life.

10
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,070
And the reason it's gonna
draw upon personal experiences

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,260
from my own life, and you
can see right here, personal,

12
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,750
is that we learn in three primary areas.

13
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,610
We learn one, from theory,

14
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,290
and then we also learn from experience.

15
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,940
And then we also learn from example,

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,890
which is the experience of others.

17
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,080
And so, theory, experience and example

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,480
are like the three categories,
three main areas we learn.

19
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,610
And just to illustrate
this with an example,

20
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,190
if you were gonna learn
how to play basketball,

21
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:45,247
first somebody would tell you,

22
00:00:45,247 --> 00:00:46,920
"Look, this is how you play basketball."

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,330
They'd give you the theory, right?

24
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,670
And then you'd go out on
the court and you'd try.

25
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,440
You'd get experience,
you'd actually try it

26
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,120
and you'd learn from trying to dribble,

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,350
trying to shoot the ball.

28
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,210
So you'd learn from theory,
you'd learn from experience.

29
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,220
And then you'd also learn from example,

30
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,140
like you'd see somebody
else do an amazing move

31
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,810
and you'd be like, "Oh, I
want to do that move, too."

32
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,310
And then you could go practice that move

33
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,840
and start to own that move yourself.

34
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:09,030
So, we learn from the
experiences of others.

35
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,970
And because we learn in these
three ways, in this course,

36
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,290
you'll be given theory.

37
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,060
You'll also be given a chance to apply

38
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,980
some of that theory with exercises

39
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:18,720
so you'll be able to
learn through experience.

40
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,283
And then I'm also gonna share

41
00:01:20,283 --> 00:01:22,650
some examples from my own life.

42
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,390
So, it'll be personal in that way.

43
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,440
This course will be personal.

44
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,090
There'll be pictures from my own life

45
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,170
and that will allow you to
learn from my own experience,

46
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,910
from the examples of others.

47
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,040
So, just letting you
know why there's so many

48
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,020
pictures of me in the course sometimes.

49
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm just trying to make
it a personable course

50
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,970
where you learn from my experiences,

51
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,220
and then also just when
you know your teacher,

52
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,040
also, data shows that you
learn more effectively

53
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,140
when you feel a connection
with your teacher.

54
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,790
So that's also why I'm keeping things

55
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,449
a little bit personal in the course.

56
00:01:52,449 --> 00:01:54,420
To manage some expectations,

57
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,290
I'm down in the basement of
our home and we've got two dogs

58
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,630
and here are pictures of those
dogs, and they're upstairs.

59
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,930
And sometimes if like the
postman or delivery person comes,

60
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,763
they'll bark.

61
00:02:04,763 --> 00:02:05,820
So if there's a little bit of barking,

62
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,160
I'll just pause and then
we'll resume the video.

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,870
Occasionally you might hear some barking,

64
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,930
but here what I'm doing is
I'm managing expectations.

65
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,170
And this is a tool that you
can use to help manage stress

66
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,270
in whatever environments you're in,

67
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,980
personal or professional.

68
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,320
But when you manage
expectations for yourself

69
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,590
and for others effectively,
that helps you manage stress.

70
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,570
And so now I don't have to be stressed

71
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,800
about the dogs barking.

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,390
And if you hear the dogs barking,

73
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:32,310
you'll understand what's going on.

74
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,320
And then there'll just be
a little break in the video

75
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,090
from when they started
barking to when they stopped.

76
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,920
And then I'll pick up
wherever we left off.

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,960
But that's helping me avoid stress,

78
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,300
just managing this expectation with you.

79
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,830
And it's also modeling for you

80
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,660
one of the tools that we can use

81
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,550
to manage stress in our own lives

82
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,590
is just to manage expectations,

83
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,660
both with ourselves
and with others, right?

84
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,760
So to have that clarity of conversation

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,460
and to have clarity about what to expect

86
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,120
and what might occur, helps
us avoid and manage stress.

87
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,500
And then the last thing I wanna say

88
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,960
about course details here
is that there's a difference

89
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,080
between soft science and hard science.

90
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,990
And so, hard science is like
math, physics, chemistry.

91
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,760
It's formulas and recipes.

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,590
It's definitive, it's discreet.

93
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:16,440
It's exactly reproducible, exactly.

94
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,700
Like if one person does it,

95
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,910
another person can exactly
achieve the exact same results.

96
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,710
Soft science, on the other hand,

97
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:27,210
is where data is collected
and analyzed, empirical data,

98
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,190
and results are more difficult to predict

99
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,720
and it's more ambiguous.

100
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,880
It goes from like ambiguous environments

101
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,380
to really wicked problems.

102
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,020
And you can see a list here
if you wanna pause the video

103
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,450
of the characteristics of wicked problems.

104
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,360
But with soft sciences, you
find that what you discover

105
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,190
are more like principles and guidelines.

106
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:46,020
And so we are definitely going to learn

107
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,790
principles and guidelines in this course.

108
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,700
And the primary takeaway
is one of those principles

109
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,830
and it's a guideline that we can implement

110
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:55,410
into our own lives, but
this is soft science.

111
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,620
It isn't like two plus two is
always going to equal four.

112
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,610
It's a soft science.

113
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,080
So it's something that you have to take

114
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,640
and apply in your own life.

115
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,490
And you take those principles
and you take those guidelines

116
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,620
you apply 'em in your own
life, and then you use them

117
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,180
and work with them in the way

118
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,130
which seems to be best for you

119
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:14,010
to achieve your own best personal results.

120
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,870
So everybody's slightly different,

121
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,140
but these are the results
that are shown on aggregate

122
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,210
through empirical data
that when you do this,

123
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,460
these results are what is achieved.

124
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,880
But in yourself, it might take some time.

125
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,770
It's not just like,
okay, added two plus two,

126
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,603
now I've got four.

127
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:31,320
You start to apply this in your life

128
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,750
and it might be a little
challenging at first to apply it

129
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,760
and then after a while
it might become easier.

130
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,560
And then it could be
this incremental thing

131
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,810
that you realize over time
the benefits of starting

132
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:42,600
to shift and change your
narratives around stress.

133
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,640
And so, it's more of a soft
science than a hard science.

134
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,410
And I just wanna make
sure that that was clear

135
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,480
from the outset that this is something

136
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,940
that is like a skill of basketball.

137
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,380
Like, basketball's not math.

138
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,700
It's definitely more of a skill.

139
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,770
And this, too, is a
skill, and it's something

140
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,530
that with practice, you will
get better at over time.

141
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,953
All right, so those are a
few of the course details.

142
00:05:00,953 --> 00:05:02,850
In the next video, we're gonna talk

143
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,280
about how as you gain new information,

144
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,010
that allows you to have new
opportunities in your life

145
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,420
to do things differently

146
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,660
and to live in more
effective and optimal ways.

147
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,010
See in the next video where we'll talk

148
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,510
about new information
equaling new opportunities

149
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:20,022
(gentle music)
