00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,510
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,010
- So here's a story from my own life

3
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,350
about changing the narrative
that I was telling myself

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,330
about stress, changing
the story I was telling

5
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,530
myself about stress,

6
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,160
like finding a new context
in which to hold a stressor,

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,520
and how when I did that, it
changed my relationship to that

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,750
which was stressing me out.

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,090
And it changed my relationship so much,

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,220
that I was able then to do that thing

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,590
which was stressing me
out more effectively

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,630
and actually become
quite good at that thing.

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,790
And so when I was in high
school, I joined the debate team.

14
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:32,430
And here's a picture of myself
in high school with a friend.

15
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,930
And part of being on the debate team is

16
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:34,860
we had to give speeches.

17
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,960
And the first time I ever
had to give a speech,

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,860
I was so nervous

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,410
that when they called my
name, I didn't get up.

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,810
I just continued to sit in
my chair in the audience

21
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,250
and then they called my name again,

22
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,350
and I still didn't get
up and sweat started

23
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:48,630
just to run down my body.

24
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:50,460
I could feel the sweat
running down my body.

25
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,590
I thought: Wow, I am so freaked out.

26
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,270
I'm so nervous. I'm so stressed.

27
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:56,370
And then they called my name a third time,

28
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,660
and I was so nervous

29
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,150
about getting up and giving a
speech, so stressed about it,

30
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,290
I still didn't get up.

31
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:03,900
And then they called my
name a fourth and final time

32
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,430
and they said, this is your last chance.

33
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,580
If you don't get up now,
you're forfeiting your,

34
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,250
you know, your right to give a speech

35
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,930
and to be entered in the contest;

36
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,220
you won't be able to give a speech.

37
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,390
And so I finally got up,

38
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,660
and I gave a speech and
it was mediocre at best.

39
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:21,810
And then afterwards I
talked to my speech coach,

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:24,120
and he said: Hey, don't try to get rid

41
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,180
of the butterflies, try to
get them to fly in formation.

42
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,890
Try to get them to fly in formation.

43
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,740
And so he gave me a new
story, a new narrative,

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,200
a new context in which
I could hold this thing

45
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,810
which was stressing me out,
getting up and giving a speech

46
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,450
in front of people, and
having that new story,

47
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,550
I was then able to relax around,

48
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,860
like, being nervous and,
oh yeah, I'm nervous.

49
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,570
I'm not trying to get
rid of the nervousness.

50
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,250
Let me just try to get those butterflies

51
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,270
to fly in formation.

52
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,640
Let me try to use all that energy that's

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,460
within me to accomplish this
thing that I want to do;

54
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,200
be able to talk in front of people,

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,370
be able to give a speech,

56
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,320
be able to be on the debate team, right?

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,750
Let me learn how to do that effectively.

58
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,770
And when I'm nervous,

59
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:05,070
let me just use that energy to deliver

60
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,550
a more energetic performance
with more enthusiasm, right?

61
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,990
So let me use that energy.

62
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,840
And so I reframed. I reframed.

63
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,030
In psychology, this is called reframing.

64
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,870
I reframed my perspective
on that stressor.

65
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,170
And in so doing, I changed my relationship

66
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,540
with that stressor, and
I was able to perform

67
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,670
at a more effective and optimal level,

68
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:28,890
and I actually became
quite good at debate,

69
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,060
and then I went on to college
and university and, you know,

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,980
and now I'm a professor,

71
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,920
and I give talks to public audiences,

72
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,240
to audiences all the time,

73
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,540
and I teach and do public
speaking as my profession.

74
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:45,300
And so that's just an
example to illustrate

75
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,710
how when we change our story,

76
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,690
our narrative that we're telling ourselves

77
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,240
about stress or something
that's stressing us out,

78
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,000
if we change the context in
which we're holding stress,

79
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,010
it changes our relationship

80
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,870
with stress or with that stressor.

81
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,630
It changes our relationship
and allows us to perform

82
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,550
at a more effective and optimal level.

83
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,310
And so this is all just to
illustrate the key takeaway

84
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,520
from the course that the
mind is incredibly powerful

85
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,000
and that the stories we
tell ourselves about stress,

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,240
influence how we respond
and react to stress.

87
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,073
In the next video,

88
00:03:16,073 --> 00:03:18,600
we're gonna take a look at
a couple of course details.

89
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,923
See you in the next video.

90
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,225
