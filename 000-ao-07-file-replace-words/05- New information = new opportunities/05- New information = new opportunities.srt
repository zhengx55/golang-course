1
00:00:00,372 --> 00:00:03,090
(gentle music)

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,923
- When I was young,

3
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:05,940
I had a teacher one time
share with me this phrase

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,280
and this phrase has
stuck with me ever since

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:11,580
and I've reflected on it many
different times in my life.

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,560
But the phrase was this, the phrase was

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,990
ignorance is the source of all suffering.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,180
Ignorance is the source of all suffering.

9
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,250
And I think this is a
really interesting phrase

10
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,170
because the corollary to this phrase

11
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,060
is that as we come out of ignorance,

12
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,560
we also come outta suffering.

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,050
As we gain new knowledge
and new information,

14
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,700
that leads to new opportunities.

15
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,220
And it allows us to live
in a more skillful way

16
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,630
where we have a more skillful life

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,950
and we can avoid suffering.

18
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:37,440
And so, I just wanna
speak to this for a moment

19
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,210
because as you go through this course,

20
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,590
you're gonna gain new knowledge,

21
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:41,760
you're gonna gain new skills,

22
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,260
you're gonna gain new information

23
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,000
and that's gonna allow
you to live your life

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,200
in a more skillful way.

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,720
And that's gonna be great
both for you individually

26
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,930
and also for your entire organization.

27
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,060
As other individuals
within your organization

28
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,100
become more skillful, as
you become more skillful

29
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,920
within an organization,
the entire organization

30
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,150
becomes more skillful.

31
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:02,430
So this will have, this
material in this course

32
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:05,970
will have individual and
organizational benefits.

33
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,680
And the amazing thing is,

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,440
is that as we each improve
ourselves individually,

35
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,510
collectively we improve

36
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,370
because a team is made up of individuals,

37
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:16,500
so as all the individuals
become more skillful,

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,030
the team becomes more skillful.

39
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,828
So if you optimize individuals,

40
00:01:19,828 --> 00:01:22,500
you optimize groups of individuals, right?

41
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,700
So optimize individuals

42
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,650
and you optimize groups of individuals.

43
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:27,930
And so this is a really
profound opportunity

44
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,050
that all of us always have,
but that you are acting upon

45
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,570
right now to gain new
knowledge, to educate ourselves,

46
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,700
to learn something new,
to come out of ignorance,

47
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,190
to come out of suffering
and to become more skillful

48
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,350
so that we can operate
in the world individually

49
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,240
and collectively in a more skillful way

50
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,770
and build a more skillful life

51
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,510
and build more skillful organizations

52
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:49,396
and realize greater success,
individually and collectively.

53
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:51,540
So it's a wonderful
thing that you're doing

54
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,160
and I just want to commend you for that

55
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,200
and encourage you to take the time,

56
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,270
to invest the time, a couple of hours.

57
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,310
And if you invest the time in this course,

58
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,380
you're gonna gain some great new

59
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,290
pieces of knowledge and
information and skills and material

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,640
which will help you in your life

61
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,040
and also benefit everybody
else that you work with.

62
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:10,687
And if other individuals
go in your organization

63
00:02:10,687 --> 00:02:13,350
go through this course,
it'll also help them.

64
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,240
So the right information
can change your life.

65
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,550
Here I am with a picture of
one of my former students.

66
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,680
He used to be a lab attendant at a college

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,480
and then he took a couple of my classes

68
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,870
and now he is an employee
at Apple Computers

69
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,760
and he was recently recognized

70
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,890
as one of the top 200 employees

71
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,780
and he got to go to a special barbecue

72
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,300
with the CEO, Tim Cook, and they hung out.

73
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,270
But if you invest in
learning and in growing,

74
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,920
you will change, new opportunities

75
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,000
will open to you in your life,

76
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,530
you'll be able to build
a more skillful life

77
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:44,070
because you will become more skillful.

78
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,780
And so that's a wonderful thing to do.

79
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,970
And so if you just take consistent action

80
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,580
in a skillful direction every
day, learn a little bit,

81
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:53,160
go through the course,
one or two videos a day,

82
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,040
over a couple of weeks, you're gonna learn

83
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,970
some amazing things

84
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,130
and it's gonna help you
build a more skillful life.

85
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,840
So never give up, just keep going.

86
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,190
I included a little quote here

87
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,980
from the Dalai Lama that I saw
one time that I really liked.

88
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,200
So you could pause the
video and read through that.

89
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,460
But just keep going.

90
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,300
You're doing great.

91
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,470
Move through all these videos.

93
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,340
and it's gonna help you
build a more skillful life.

94
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,780
See you in the next video where
we will continue learning.

95
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,976
See you in the next video.

96
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:22,643
