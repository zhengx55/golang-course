00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:03.090
(soft music)

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:04.890
<v ->So the key takeaway from this course</v>

3
00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.050
and from the new research in science

4
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.300
that has been done around stress management,

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.880
the key takeaway is that the stories we tell ourselves

6
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.910
about stress really have a profound impact

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.920
upon our response to stress,

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.770
both physiologically, biologically, intellectually,

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.120
emotionally, right?

10
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.620
The stories we tell ourselves,

11
00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.850
the narratives we tell ourselves,

12
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.310
the context in which we hold stress, right,

13
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.650
that has a profound impact

14
00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.660
upon our ability to deal with stress.

15
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.620
And so this data

16
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.570
which has been revealed through this research

17
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.080
and this science on stress management is disruptive data.

18
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.830
It's disrupting the current old way of doing things,

19
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.370
and it's introducing a new way of doing it,

20
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.840
a better practice, right?

21
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.530
Like this is the best practice, but it's a completely,

22
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.030
it's a complete paradigm shift.

23
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.060
It's the complete opposite end of the spectrum, right?

24
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.540
It's a 180 degree contrarian perspective

25
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.190
from the old way of looking at things.

26
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.230
So the data that has been uncovered

27
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.750
and revealed through this research and science,

28
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.120
this new research and science on stress management,

29
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.060
has really kind of changed and upended

30
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.230
the current cultural perspective view and approach

31
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.120
to dealing with and managing with stress.

32
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.440
So the old way, right,

33
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.900
this is the pretty much still the current paradigm

34
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.580
most people are operating under,

35
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.410
but the old message we got about stress

36
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.060
was that stress is bad, it makes you sick,

37
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.350
and stress was demonized.

38
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.360
And you could see this on magazine covers

39
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.280
and in newspaper articles, right?

40
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.810
Like every, and it was kind of like,

41
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.640
try to get rid of stress if you can.

42
00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.580
But that's a really hard thing to do because we are all,

43
00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.480
always as humans,

44
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.640
gonna have stressors and challenges in our lives.

45
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.070
And so the new message and what the new research

46
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.680
and the new data supports and shows

47
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.380
is that if we tell ourselves a new skillful story

48
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.430
around stress,

49
00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.070
that's actually gonna change everything for us.

50
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.450
It changes the whole game,

51
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.730
changes our physiological and biological response,

52
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.430
changes our emotional and intellectual response,

53
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.650
and it helps us manage

54
00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.940
and deal with stress more effectively,

55
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.560
and we're gonna see data on that,

56
00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.240
but here we're just getting this main takeaway.

57
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.940
So the new message that we have to start

58
00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.430
to integrate and implement into our lives

59
00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.290
is that stress is good.

60
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.060
It's a totally contrarian message

61
00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.530
from the old message, right?

62
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.840
Stress is good, it actually makes you strong,

63
00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.510
it makes you more resilient and performant and focused.

64
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.670
It exists within us to help us.

65
00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.490
And so a new narrative that you might start to tell yourself

66
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.893
is that life is better without stress,

67
00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.000
and when stress arises, it is here to help you,

68
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.370
make you stronger, energize you, motivate you,

69
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.720
and focus you, right?

70
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.150
And so some examples of, you know,

71
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.890
how stress is really beneficial

72
00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.160
to making you stronger and to helping you in your life

73
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.110
are like weightlifting, right,

74
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.330
you need stress to get stronger muscles.

75
00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.120
Vaccines, right, love and relationships

76
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.500
and relationship bonds,

77
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.830
and mental processing and physical recovery, you know,

78
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.110
and even your own personal growth and progress

79
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.880
and evolution in your own life.

80
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.750
They are all like aided and made better

81
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.430
through some stress, right?

82
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.430
Some stress is beneficial to helping you progress

83
00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.900
in many different areas of your life.

84
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.480
And so, we'll explore those examples in more depth

85
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.950
in a video coming up soon,

86
00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.620
but we're just starting here to shift our narrative,

87
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.063
our perspective on stress,

88
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.570
and we're giving up an old way of doing something,

89
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.910
and we're starting to adopt a new paradigm,

90
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.320
a new way of doing things, right?

91
00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.270
We're starting to release this old message,

92
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.370
and it can be hard to release it, 'cause we've,

93
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.890
it's been ingrained into us and, you know,

94
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.950
through our culture, through the media for quite some time

95
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.783
that stress is bad

96
00:03:32.783 --> 00:03:34.650
and we should try to avoid it and get rid of it.

97
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.530
But we're starting to try to tell ourselves a new narrative

98
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.940
that actually stress can be something

99
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.080
that's beneficial for us.

100
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.913
It could be good for us.

101
00:03:40.913 --> 00:03:42.300
It could make us stronger, more resilient,

102
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.500
performant, and focused.

103
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.060
It exists within us to help us.

104
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.760
And by doing this, it's actually going to become the case,

105
00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.230
it's going to become so.

106
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.140
And so that new narrative in that cloud right there

107
00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.640
is a nice one to tell yourself.

108
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.650
And so the main takeaway, right,

109
00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.810
from the research and from this course

110
00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.550
is that your beliefs about stress

111
00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.240
determine the impact of stress on your body and life.

112
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.500
Wow, that's pretty amazing.

113
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.990
Your beliefs about stress determine the impact of stress

114
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.220
on your body and life.

115
00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.590
And this is, again, all research backed.

116
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.490
So in the next video,

117
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.880
we're gonna see an example about changing our narrative

118
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.890
around stress, and I'll illustrate that

119
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.930
with an example from my life,

120
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.360
and I'll show you how we actually start to do this

121
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.193
in our own lives.

122
00:04:22.193 --> 00:04:23.954
See ya in the next video.

123
00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:26.371
